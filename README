	#FOLDER: test/
		contains pmapi emulator(unfinished), which should returns small subset of database info.
		test/pmapi-emu.php can be deployeed on apache server for testing.

		@pmapi-emu.php now response to 4 types of request: getBacteriaList, getBacteria, getExperiment, getPlate.
		(name of types of request are slicely different from old pmapi).

	#view/pmapiClient.js 
		is to communicate with pmapi(/emulator) to get {json} data.
		Ajax does not allow communicate with remote hosts. So using test/ for pmapiClient testing.

		Once pmapi-emu.php is configure, pmapiClient.js suppose to be able to request data from the pmapi-emu
	#view/module_pm.js 
		is the file of pm modules. Should be build with pmapiCient.

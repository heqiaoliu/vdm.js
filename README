	test/ contains pmapi emulator(unfinished), which should returns small subset of database info.
	view/pmapiClient.js is to communicate with pmapi(/emulator) to get {json} data. Ajax does not allow communicate with remote hosts. So test is for pmapiClient testing.
	module_pm.js is the file of pm modules.
